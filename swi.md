Quick start (Linux):

Write a prolog program as a text file with a .pl ending. For example, program.pl.
Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and navigate to the directory where you stored your program.
Open SWI-Prolog by invoking swipl.
In SWI-Prolog, type [program] to load the program, i.e. the file name in brackets, but without the ending.
In order to query the loaded program, type goals and watch the output.
Alternatively, you can also load the program by passing its name as a parameter to SWI-Prolog: swipl -s program.pl.
To exit SWI-Prolog, type :e
